We developed an automated apparatus and single pellet reach training paradigm for group housed mice within the home cage. This task allows individualized training progression and handedness of presenta...
tion for each mouse, minimizes stress induced by experimenter interaction, and enables experiments and data collection on a massive scale, previously impossible due to the demands of one-on-one behavioral testing. We demonstrate an optimized set of task parameters and t...
he utility of this apparatus for assessing lesion-induced motor impairments. Herein, we provide an open-source, scalable, platform for training and assessing skilled reaching in mice with minimal need for experimenter handling that is equivalent to gold-standard, manual...
