Load a sensible subset of the fMRI confounds generated with fMRIprep in python (Esteban et al., 2018). The predefined denoising strategies are all adapted from Ciric et al. 2017. Check the docstring of each strategy for more info and a list of parameters. It is also possible to fine-tune a subset of noise components and their parameters. 

This package is at an alpha stage of development. The API may still be subject to changes. The beta release is planned for May 2021.
