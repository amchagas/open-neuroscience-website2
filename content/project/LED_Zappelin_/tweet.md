Two-photon (2P) microscopy is a cornerstone technique in neuroscience research. However, combining 2P imaging with sp #Hardware#Simulations#Optogenetics#Behaviour#Microscopes#CalciumImaging#Fluorescence ...
ectrally arbitrary light stimulation can be challenging due to crosstalk between stimulation light and fluorescence detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple and low-cost electronic solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller and a TLC5947 LED driver to...
 rapidly time-interleave stimulation and detection epochs during scans. Implemented for less than $100, our design can independently drive up to 24 arbitrary spectrum LEDs to meet user requirements. We demonstrate the utility of our stimulator for colour vision experime...
