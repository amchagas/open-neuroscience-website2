ts (i.e. you can match human labeling accuracy) with minimal training data (typically 50-200 frames). We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. The package is open source, ...
fast, robust, and can be used to compute 3D pose estimates. Please see the original paper and the latest work below.  This package is collaboratively developed by the Mathis Group & Mathis Lab at EPFL/Harvard.The code is freely available and easy to install in a few cli...
