cellfinder is software from the Margrie Lab at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for automated 3D cell detection and registration of whole-brain images (e.g. serial two-photon or #DataAnalysis#Software#Fluorescence ...
 lightsheet imaging).Itâ€™s a work in progress, but cellfinder can:Detect labelled cells in 3D in whole-brain images (many hundreds of GB)Register the image to an atlas (such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas)Segment the brain based on the reference atlasCalculate the volume...
 of each brain area, and the number of labelled cells within itTransform everything into standard space for analysis and visualisation...
