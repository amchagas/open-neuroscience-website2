Neuroimaging researchers require a diverse collection of bespoke command-line and graphical tools to analyse data and answer research questions. Installing and maintaining a neuroimaging software setup is challenging and often results in un-reproducible environments. Container technology, such as docker or singularity, enables the execution of software on different operating systems and could aid in distributing scientific software. We are developing NeuroDesk, a platform build on container technology for processing and analysing neuroimaging data with the aim to lower the barrier of using various neuroimaging software in a reproducible environment, so that researchers spend less time on setting up and maintaining an analysis environment.
