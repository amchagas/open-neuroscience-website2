ACQ4 is a python-based platform for experimental neurophysiology
developed at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It includes support for patch-clamp electrophysiology, multiphoton imaging, scanning laser photostimulation, and many other experimental techniques. ACQ4 is highly modular and extensible, allowing support to be added for new types of devices, techniques, user-interface modules, and analyses.
The latest ACQ4 version is available on github:
