lab.js makes online experimentation easy. It's a free, open, online study builder and data collection framework for the behavioral, neuro- and cognitive sciences. Studies built with lab.js run in the laboratory as well as online, across a wide variety of data collection platforms, and provide excellent performance for all modes of stimulus presentation.
