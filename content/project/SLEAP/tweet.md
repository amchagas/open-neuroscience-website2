SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses) is a multi-animal pose tracker based on deep learning. It is the successor of LEAP (Pereira et al., Nature Methods, 2019) and was designed to deal with the #Behaviour#Software ...
 problem of tracking body landmarks of multiple freely interacting animals.Using deep learning, SLEAP trains neural network models from few user annotations to enable highly accurate body part localization, grouping and tracking. It supports multiple neural network arch...
itectures, including pretrained state-of-the-art models and lightweight customizable architectures. SLEAP has been used successfully to track mice, fruit flies, bees and other species of animals under a variety of experimental and imaging conditions.The software was des...
