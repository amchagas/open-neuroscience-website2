This is a diffusion-weighted MRI processing Matlab toolbox (including binaries), which can be used to:
• Compute the Q-Ball Imaging Orientation Distribution Function in Constant Solid Angle (CSA-ODF) (Aganj et al, MRM 2010).
• Perform Hough-transform tractography (Aganj et al, MedIA 2011).
• Visualize ODFs and tracts, and export them for further analysis.
• Verify the correctness of the diffusion gradient table (Aganj, Sci Rep 2018).
• Compute and interactively visualize the connectivity matrix.
• Augment the connectivity matrix with indirect connections (Aganj et al, ISMRM 2014).
