Two-photon calcium imaging is now widely used to infer neuronal dynamics from changes in fluorescence of an indicator. However, state of the art computational too #CalciumImaging#Software#Behaviour#DataAnalysis ...
ls are not optimized for the reliable detection of fluorescence transients from highly synchronous neurons located in densely packed regions such as the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus during early postnatal  stages  of  development.  Indeed,the  latest  analytic...
al  tools  often  lack  proper benchmark  measurements.  To  meet  this  challenge,  we  first  developed  a  graphical  user interface allowing for a precise manual detection of all calcium transients from imaged neurons based on the visualization of the calcium imagin...
