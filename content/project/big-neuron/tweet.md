Big Neuron wants to create a standard for the field of single neuron reconstruction. Because the data available comes from different structures, different organisms, using different collection and a #Simulation ...
nalyses algorithms and is in the range of petabytes (according to the project site), there is a strong need for standards that will allow this huge amount of data to be compared.The project aims to develop a common platform and algorithms for data analysis to benchmark ...
as many open source neuronal reconstruction models as possible.For more information visit theirÂ GitHub repository....
