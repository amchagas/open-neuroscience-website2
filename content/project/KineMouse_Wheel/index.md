Who says you can't reinvent the wheel?! This running wheel for head-fixed mice allows 3D reconstruction of body kinematics using a single camera and DeepLabCut (or similar) software. A lightweight, transparent polycarbonate floor and a mirror mounted on the inside allow two views to be captured simultaneously. All parts are commercially available or laser cut. See example usage here: https://elifesciences.org/articles/63596
