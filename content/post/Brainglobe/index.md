## World Wide Series Seminar  

{{< youtube Ndsssf_gHns >}}

BrainGlobe is a suite of Python-based computational neuroanatomy software tools. We provide software packages for the analysis and visualisation of neuroanatomical data, particularly from whole-brain microscopy. In addition, we provide tools for working with brain atlases, to simplify development of new tools and aid collaboration and cooperation by adopting common standards.

Our tools include:

- [BrainGlobe Atlas API](https://open-neuroscience.com/post/brainglobe_atlas_api/) - A lightweight python module to interact with atlases for systems neuroscience

- [Cellfinder](https://open-neuroscience.com/post/cellfinder/) - Automated 3D cell detection and registration of whole-brain microscopy images

- [Brainrender](https://open-neuroscience.com/post/brainrender/) - A Python based software for visualization of neuroanatomical and morphological data.
