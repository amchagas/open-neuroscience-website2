Stalefish is a tool to analyse gene expression from ISH or other histology slice images. From your 2D brain slice images you can build a 3D expression surface from a brain structure such as the isocortex or the hippocampus. You can then convert the 3D surfaces into 2D expression maps, get depth-based expression or identify digital micro-punches for analysis.
