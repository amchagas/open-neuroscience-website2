The easiest way to get started creating online behavioural experiments! psygo is a CLI tool that streamlines the development of custom jsPsych plugins, allowing you to create custom behavioural experiments that can be run online. psygo also helps you test your experiment locally. All the hard work is done for you, from setting up a project, to preparing it for administration.
