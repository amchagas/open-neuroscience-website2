omplex behavioural tasks using a clean, intuitive, and flexible syntax for specifying tasks as state machines. User created task definition files, written in Python, run directly on the microcontroller, supported by pyControl framework code. This gives users the power a...
nd simplicity of Python for specifying task behaviour, while allowing advanced users low-level access to the microcontroller hardware. pyControl hardware consists of a breakout board and a set of devices such as nose-pokes, audio boards, LED drivers, rotary encoders and...
